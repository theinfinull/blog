# TODOs

## Maybe

- [ ] implement Quote.astro component (centered, aesthetic booklike quotes)
- [ ] make a nice component or style for blog images (lil rounded corners and stuff)
- [ ] move to proper search like pagefind

## Release Blocking

- [-] change b/w favicon (nah, this is fine)
- [x] re implement search
- [x] migrate from google fonts to own
- [x] subpost support
- [-] publish to medium script : (seems to be not available for now) https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213480228-API-Importing
- [ ] some bugs in publishing script for todo
  - fixed status (logged and saved to metadata), but use it to not repush to draft (if post is already published) (atleast show a warning)

# NOTE TO FUTURE SELF

- **Never put ads on this site**. make site slower, annoy readers including you and make site ugly
- **Keep this on a top-level domain**. host it something like `yadayada.com` and use subdomains for projects, tools and stuff like `projectname.yadayada.com`

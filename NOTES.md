# TODOs

## Maybe

- [ ] implement Quote.astro component (centered, aesthetic booklike quotes)
- [ ] make a nice component or style for blog images (lil rounded corners and stuff)
- [ ] move to proper search like pagefind

## Release Blocking

- [-] change b/w favicon (nah, this is fine)
- [x] re implement search
- [x] migrate from google fonts to own
- [x] subpost support

# NOTE TO FUTURE SELF

- **Never put ads on this site**. make site slower, annoy readers including you and make site ugly
- **Keep this on a top-level domain**. host it something like `yadayada.com` and use subdomains for projects, tools and stuff like `projectname.yadayada.com`

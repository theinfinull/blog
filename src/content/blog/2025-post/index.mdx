# Who Am I?

I do not sleep at night. Why? I got a city to protect. Every person here is under my protection.
- I can fly
- I can run
- I even eat waffles

You know what i am a batman who knows how to `code`.

```java title="Batman.java" showLineNumbers={true} showLineNumbers startLineNumber={2} ins={"Added cool code":4-5} del={"Deleted dangerous code":6-7} {"Interesting code":8-14}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("How's that!😎")
    System.out.println("Don't get hacked by me.")

    System.out.println("Don't get hacked by me.")
    System.out.println("Don't get hacked by me.")

    System.out.println("Don't get hacked by me.")
    System.out.println("Don't get hacked by me.")

    if (isHacked) {
        System.out.println("I am hacked!")
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("I am not hacked!")
    }
}
```

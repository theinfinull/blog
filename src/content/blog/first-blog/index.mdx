Hello, unknown internet person! 👋🏻

Welcome to my blog - this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and learnings as a developer. From web development and backend engineering to random cool stuff I discover along the way, this is where it all goes.

## What to Expect ?

Honestly? A bit of everything. 

I'm not entirely sure how this site will evolve over time, but I'll try my best to make it interesting, useful and obviously - not boring. 

## See Ya 👋🏻
